Almost every biological process within the human body involves proteins. This makes them important targets for the discovery of new drugs, especially in the context of cancer treatment. Proteins are the building blocks of life, playing an important role in almost all cellular functions. Misfunctioning or overproduced proteins can cause diseases, including cancer, to develop and progress (Ardito et al., 2017). In this way, drugs targeting these proteins can provide an extremely effective means of treating cancer (Gross et al., 2015). Several cancers have been successfully treated with this approach, and ongoing research is focused on identifying additional proteins with therapeutic potential.

It is well understood that many cancers arise from alterations or mutations in specific proteins. Therefore, targeting these specific proteins is a logical strategy in cancer treatment (Cohen, 2002). These mutations can lead to abnormal cell growth, resistance to cell death, and other hallmarks of cancer (Cheng, Kovács, & Barabási, 2019). For example, the BCR-ABL protein, produced by a specific chromosomal translocation in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), is an abnormal fusion protein that continuously signals cells to induce unregulated proliferation (Druker et al., 2001). The discovery of this protein as a key driver of CML led to the development of Imatinib, a drug that specifically inhibits BCR-ABL activity. Imatinib’s success revolutionized cancer therapy by providing a targeted treatment that dramatically improved patient outcomes with relatively few side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy (Mullard, 2021).

Another example is the targeting of the HER2 protein in breast cancer. HER2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that, when overexpressed, drives aggressive cell growth and division (Schlessinger, 2000). The development of Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a monoclonal antibody that targets HER2, has significantly improved survival rates in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. By binding to HER2, Trastuzumab blocks the signaling pathways that promote tumor growth, thereby inhibiting the progression of the disease (Slamon et al., 2001).

The importance of proteins as drug targets extends beyond just the treatment of cancer. As our understanding of the human proteome continues to grow, so too does the potential for discovering new drug targets. The field of proteomics, which studies the structure and function of proteins, is increasingly contributing to the identification of novel therapeutic targets and the development of more effective, personalized medicines (Ardito et al., 2017).

Proteins remain indispensable targets in the fight against cancer. Through the identification and inhibition of key proteins involved in cancer development and progression, targeted therapies have the potential to improve patient outcomes significantly. The examples highlighted of BCR-ABL in CML and HER2 in breast cancer are just but an  illustration of the transformative impact that protein-targeted drugs can have on cancer treatment.
